# Home-Network-Security-Wireshark
Hands-on project focused on securing a home network by configuring a router with WPA2-PSK encryption, enabling 5GHz Wi-Fi, and setting a strong password. Network traffic was analyzed using Wireshark to identify common threats and apply fundamental security measures.

## Objective
To secure a home network by configuring a router with WPA2-PSK encryption, enabling 5GHz Wi-Fi, and setting a strong password. Network traffic was then analyzed using Wireshark to identify common threats and apply basic security measures.

## Tools & Technologies
- Router Configuration
- WPA2-PSK Encryption
- Wireshark

## Steps Taken
1. Configured home router with WPA2-PSK encryption.
2. Set a strong, complex Wi-Fi password.
3. Enabled 5GHz Wi-Fi for improved performance and security.
4. Captured and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark.
5. Identified potential threats and verified secure traffic.

## Results
